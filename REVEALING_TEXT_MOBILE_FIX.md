# Revealing Text Mobile Fix - KraftHaus Website

## Issue Identified
The revealing text (typing animation) in the home page banner was not visible in mobile mode. The text "Creative Digital" with the typing animation was not displaying properly on mobile devices.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by several factors:

1. **Color Contrast**: The `border-bottom-1` class had a light gray color (`#A8A8A8`) that was not visible on mobile
2. **CSS Conflicts**: Responsive CSS might have been hiding or affecting the typing animation elements
3. **Animation Elements**: The typing animation wrapper and caret elements might not have been properly visible on mobile

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Color Visibility Fix**
```css
/* Ensure revealing text is visible on all mobile breakpoints */
.rts_hero__title .border-bottom-1 {
    color: #fff !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
    visibility: visible !important;
    display: inline-block !important;
    position: relative !important;
}
```

### 2. **Typing Animation Elements Fix**
```css
/* Ensure typing animation works on mobile */
.rts_hero__title .border-bottom-1 .typing-wrapper {
    display: inline-block !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
    visibility: visible !important;
}

.rts_hero__title .border-bottom-1 .typing-caret {
    display: inline-block !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
    visibility: visible !important;
}
```

### 3. **Responsive Breakpoint Coverage**
Applied the fixes across all mobile breakpoints:

- **Large Mobile (1199px and below)**: Basic visibility fix
- **Tablet (991px and below)**: Enhanced visibility with typing animation support
- **Mobile (767px and below)**: Full typing animation support
- **Small Mobile (575px and below)**: Complete mobile optimization
