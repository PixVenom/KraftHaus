# Desktop Layout Fixes - KraftHaus Website

## Issue Identified
The home page was "messed up" in desktop mode due to responsive CSS conflicts that were hiding the navigation and affecting the layout on desktop screens.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. **Navigation Visibility Issue**
- **Problem**: The navigation was being hidden on desktop due to missing CSS rules
- **Cause**: Existing CSS hid navigation on tablets (768px-991px) but had no rule to show it on desktop (992px+)
- **Impact**: Main navigation was completely hidden on desktop screens

### 2. **Responsive Grid Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Responsive grid CSS was affecting desktop layout
- **Cause**: Media queries were too broad and affected desktop screens
- **Impact**: Column layouts were being overridden on desktop

### 3. **Spacing Issues**
- **Problem**: Responsive spacing rules were affecting desktop
- **Cause**: Media queries without proper min-width constraints
- **Impact**: Padding and margins were being reduced on desktop

## Fixes Applied
